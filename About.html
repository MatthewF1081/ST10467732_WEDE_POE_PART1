  <h2>About Alu-Cab</h2>
  <p>	Born in Africa, Built for the Wild

 

It started with a simple desire: make it better. A plumber, tired of inadequate canopies, built his own. That spirit of innovation ignited Alu-Cab.

 

Today, over 600 of us craft Alu-Cab gear in our Cape Town workshop, shipping to 73 countries and distributing through a network of 300 dealerships.
